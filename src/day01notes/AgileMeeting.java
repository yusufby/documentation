    //Sprint planning meetings
    /* a spring planning meeting sets up your entire team for success throughout the sprint.
    They take place at the start of each sprint and should last approximately
     an hour per week-length of the sprint. */
    //The goal of the sprint planning session is for the scrum team to meet and have a conversation
    // regarding what work they want to accomplish in the next sprint, and prioritize each task and
    // assign it to each sprint member.

    /*2 Scrum meetings*/
    //A scrum meeting, otherwise referred to as a daily stand-up,
    // is a quick check-in with your team. They occur once per day for every day of the sprint,
    // are usually no more than 15 minutes in length, and typically take place in the morning.
    /*During these stand-ups, each member of the development team will quickly share with other members exactly
     what they’re working on, how their progress is going, and if they’re experiencing any blockers.*/

    /*3 Backlog grooming meetings*/
    //A backlog grooming meeting, sometimes referred to as a backlog refinement meeting or
    // a grooming scrum, is used to review items on the backlog.
    // In this case, a backlog is a list of any upcoming items and things that need to be done by your team.
    // The goal of these meetings is to keep the backlog as accurate and up to date as possible so
    // it can be pulled and referencing in upcoming sprints.
    /*Who attends backlog grooming meetings?
    Backlog grooming meetings can occur on a regular basis but typically take place towards the end of a sprint.
    They’re usually between 30 minutes and one hour in length and
    in attendance are the scrum master, product owner, and the development team. */

    /*4 Sprint retrospective meeting */
    //During a sprint retrospective meeting, the development team, scrum master,
    // and product owner will all discuss their work together on the specific project or agenda.
