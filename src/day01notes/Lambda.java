    // Lambda is a functional programming, we have had Lambda in Java with version 8
    //        Functional programming focuses on "What to do", with structured programming we focus on "How to do"

    //        We cannot use Maps directly in functional programming, but we can convert Maps to Sets and use them
    //        we can use entrySet()
